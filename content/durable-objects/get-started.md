# Get started

This guide will instruct you through:

- Writing a class that defines a Durable Object.
- Instantiating and communicationg with a Durable Object from another Worker via the Fetch API.
- Uploading the Durable Object and Worker to Cloudflare's servers using Wrangler. 

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages), if you have not already.
2. Install [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).
3. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

{{<Aside type="note" header="Node.js version manager">}}
Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), discussed later in this guide, requires a Node version of `16.13.0` or later.

## 1. Enable Durable Objects in the dashboard

To enable Durable Objects, you will need to purchase Workers Paid plan:

 1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
 2. Go to **Workers & Pages** > **Plans**. 
 3. Select **Purchase Workers Paid** and complete the payment process to enable Durable Objects.

 ## 2. Create a Worker project

You will access your Durable Object from a Worker, the producer Worker. 

To create a producer Worker, run:

```sh
$ npm create cloudflare@latest # or 'yarn create cloudflare@latest'
```
In your terminal, you will be asked a series of questions related to your project: 

1. Name your new Worker directory by specifying where you want to create your application.
2. Select `"Hello World" script` as the type of application you want to create.
3. Answer `no` to using TypeScript.
4. Answer `no` to using Git.
5. Answer `no` to deploying your Worker.

This will create a new directory, which will include both a `src/worker.js` Worker script, and a [`wrangler.toml`](/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration file. After you create your Worker, you will create a class to define a Durable Object.

 ## 3. Write a class to define a Durable Object

Before you create and access a Durable Object, you must define its behavior by exporting an ordinary JavaScript class. 

{{<Aside type="note">}}
If you do not use JavaScript, you will need a [shim](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shim) to translate your class definition to a JavaScript class.
{{</Aside>}}

Your class `DurableObjectExample` will have a constructor with two parameters. The first parameter, `state`, passed to the class constructor contains state specific to the Durable Object, including methods for accessing storage. The second parameter, `env`, contains any bindings you have associated with the Worker when you uploaded it. 

Note that this means bindings are no longer global variables. For example, if you had a secret binding `MY_SECRET`, you must access it as `env.MY_SECRET`.

```js
---
filename: worker.js
---
export class DurableObjectExample {
  constructor(state, env) {}
}
```
Workers communicate with a Durable Object via the fetch API. Like a Worker, a Durable Object listens for incoming fetch events by registering an event handler. For a Durable Object, the fetch handler is defined as a method on the class.

```js
---
filename: worker.js
---
export class DurableObjectExample {
  constructor(state, env) {}

  async fetch(request) {
    return new Response("Hello World");
  }
}
```

A Worker can pass information to a Durable Object via headers, the HTTP method, the Request body, or the Request URI.

{{<Aside type="note">}}

HTTP requests received by a Durable Object do not come directly from the Internet. They come from other Worker code â€“ possibly other Durable Objects, or Workers. Durable Objects use HTTP for familiarity, but plan to introduce other protocols in the future.

{{</Aside>}}

## 4. Configure Durable Object bindings

Configure Durable Object bindings in the `wrangler.toml` by providing the class name and script name whose objects you wish to access using the binding. The script name can be omitted when creating a binding for a class that is defined in the same Worker as the binding.

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
[durable_objects]
bindings = [
  { name = "EXAMPLE_CLASS", class_name = "DurableObjectExample" } # Binding to our DurableObjectExample class
]
```

The `[durable_objects]` section has one subsection called `bindings`, which is an array of tables. 

Each table contains the following fields:

  - `name` - Required. The binding name to use within your Worker.
  - `class_name` - Required. The class name you wish to bind to.
  - `script_name` - Optional. Defaults to the current [environment's](/workers/wrangler/environments/) script.

If you are using Wrangler [environments](/workers/wrangler/environments/), you must specify any Durable Object bindings you wish to use on a per-environment basis. 

Durable Object bindings are not inherited. For example, you can define an environment named `staging` as below:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
[env.staging]
durable_objects.bindings = [
  {name = "EXAMPLE_CLASS", class_name = "DurableObjectExample"}
]
```

Because Wrangler appends the [environment name](/workers/wrangler/environments/) to the top-level name when publishing, for a Worker named `worker-name` the above example is equivalent to:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
[env.staging]
durable_objects.bindings = [
  {name = "EXAMPLE_CLASS", class_name = "DurableObjectExample", script_name = "worker-name-staging"}
]
```

`"EXAMPLE_CLASS"` in the staging environment is bound to a different script name compared to the top-level `"EXAMPLE_CLASS"` binding, and will therefore access different objects with different persistent storage. 

If you want an environment-specific binding that accesses the same objects as the top-level binding, specify the top-level script name explicitly:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
[env.another]
durable_objects.bindings = [
  {name = "EXAMPLE_CLASS", class_name = "DurableObjectExample", script_name = "worker-name"}
]
```

## 5. Configure Durable Object classes with migrations

Migrations are performed through the `[[migrations]]` configurations key in your `wrangler.toml` file.  

Migrations require a migration tag, which is defined by the `tag` property in each migration entry. 

Migration tags are treated like unique names and are used to determine which migrations have already been applied. Once a given script has a migration tag set on it, all future script uploads must include a migration tag.

The migration list is an ordered array of tables, specified as a top-level key in your `wrangler.toml` file. The migration list is inherited by all environments and cannot be overridden by a specific environment.

All migrations are applied at deployment. Each migration can only be applied once per [environment](/workers/wrangler/environments/).

To illustrate an example migrations workflow, the `DurableObjectExample` class can be initially defined with:

```toml
---
filename: wrangler.toml
---
[[migrations]]
tag = "v1" # Should be unique for each entry
new_classes = ["DurableObjectExample"] # Array of new classes
```

Refer to [Durable Objects migrations](/durable-objects/learning/durable-objects-migrations/) to learn more about the migration process.

## 6. Instantiate and communicate with a Durable Object

Durable Objects do not receive requests directly from the Internet. Durable Objects receive requests from Workers or other Durable Objects. 

This is achieved by configuring a binding in the calling Worker for each Durable Object class that you would like it to be able to talk to. These bindings must be configured at upload time. Methods exposed by the binding can be used to communicate with particular Durable Object instances.

A Worker talks to a Durable Object through a [stub](/durable-objects/how-to/create-durable-object-stubs/). 

The class binding's `get()` method returns a stub to the particular Durable Object instance, and the stub's `fetch()` method sends HTTP [requests](/workers/runtime-apis/request/) to the instance.


### Example of the fetch handler implementation

The fetch handler in the example below implements the Worker that communicates to the Durable Object.  


Durable Objects must be written in ES Modules syntax. ES Modules differ from regular JavaScript files in that they have imports and exports. For example, [to write a class that defines a Durable Object](/durable-objects/get-started/#1-write-a-class-to-define-a-durable-object), you use `export class DurableObjectExample`. To implement a fetch handler, export a method named `fetch()` in an `export default {}` block.


```js
---
filename: worker.js
---
export default {

  async fetch(request, env) {

    let id = env.EXAMPLE_CLASS.idFromName(new URL(request.url).pathname);

    let stub = env.EXAMPLE_CLASS.get(id);

    let response = await stub.fetch(request);

    return response;
  },
};
```

In the code above, you have:

1. Exported your Worker's main event handlers, such as the `fetch()` handler for receiving HTTP requests.
2. Passed `env` into the `fetch()` handler. Bindings are delivered as a property of the environment object passed as the second parameter when an event handler or class constructor is invoked. By calling the `idFromName()` function on the binding, you use a string-derived object ID. You can also ask the system to [generate random unique IDs](/durable-objects/how-to/access-durable-object-from-a-worker/#generate-ids-randomly). System-generated unique IDs have better performance characteristics, but require you to store the ID somewhere to access the Object again later. 
3. Derived an object ID from the URL path. `EXAMPLE_CLASS.idFromName()` always returns the same ID when given the same string as input (and called on the same class), but never the same ID for two different strings (or for different classes). In this case, you are creating a new object for each unique path. 
4. Constructed the stub for the Durable Object using the ID. A stub is a client object used to send messages to the Durable Object.
5. Forwarded the request to the Durable Object. `stub.fetch()` has the same signature as the global `fetch()` function, except that the request is always sent to the object, regardless of the request's URL.  The first time you send a request to a new object, the object will be created for us. If you do not store durable state in the object, it will automatically be deleted later (and recreated if you request it again). If you store durable state, then the object may be evicted from memory but its durable state will be kept  permanently.
6. Received an HTTP response back to the client with `return response`.

Refer to [Access a Durable Object from a Worker](/durable-objects/how-to/access-durable-object-from-a-worker/) to  learn more about communicating to a Durable Object.

## 7. Upload a Durable Object Worker

{{<Aside type="warning" header="Custom Wrangler installation instructions">}}

You must use [Wrangler latest version](/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) to manage Durable Objects.

{{</Aside>}}

To upload Workers that implement or bind to Durable Objects, use [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/), the Workers CLI. 

Open your terminal and run the following command to upload a Durable Object Worker:

```sh
$ wrangler dev
```

### Specify the main module

Workers that use ES Modules syntax must have a main module specified from which all Durable Objects and event handlers are exported. The file that should be treated as the main module is configured using the `main = "src/worker.js"` section of `wrangler.toml`. 

Refer to [Custom builds documentation](/workers/wrangler/custom-builds/) for more details.

## 8. Test your Durable Objects project

If you copy the `DurableObjectExample` and fetch handler code from above into a generated Wrangler project, publish it using a `--new-class` migration, and make a request to it, you will notice that your request was stored in a Durable Object:

```sh
$ curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" https://<worker-name>.<your-namespace>.workers.dev/ --data "important data!"
***.***.***.*** stored important data!
```

By finishing this tutorial, you have now created a class that defines a Durable Object, configured bindings and migrations, uploaded and tested your Durable Objects project.
